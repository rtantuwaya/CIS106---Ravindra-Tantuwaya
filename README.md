CIS106 W01 - COMPUTER LOGIC AND PROGRAMMING TECHNOLOGY (Spring 2025 Credit Courses)
My primary goal for this course is to build a strong foundation in both web development and software development. I am also eager to dive deeper into frameworks with the goal of building impressive website projects while advancing my software development skills. Outside of work and school, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, watching sports, and working out to stay active and energized!
